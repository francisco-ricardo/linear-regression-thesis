# ABSTRACT

The control of manufacturing process is important for industry in
general. However, few works have been written about how to reach
this goal in the printed circuit boards industry.
This paper studies the task of Linear Regression of Data Mining
process applying it to the manufacturing process of printed circuit
boards for the prediction of drilling cycle time. It was built a
database with real cycle time and was created a software to extract
data from numerico control programs. Therefore the data were low-level
and high degree of complexity. The data were split into two
independent groups, one for training and another one for testing.
The prediction model of the drilling cycle time based on
Linear Regression had a standard error of 8.321 minutes but the
initial target was to obtain a model with standard error of
2.0 minutes. Then the Linear Regression model was compared with
two other algorithms: M5 Models Trees and M5 Rules.
The first ond had a standard error of 6.525 minutes and the second
one had 8.555 minutes. It was shown that the dataset was not
representative enough to get a more efficient prediction model.
Moreover, studying the data extracted by the extraction program was
possible the discovery of previously unknown and useful information
to the manufacturing process. It enabled to develop algorithms to
deal with the following issues: calculatation of drill tools
consumption, number of drill bits made by a slot, number o drills
bits made by a nibble and calculation of the drill path.
The technologies used in research are public domain and met the
expectations.
